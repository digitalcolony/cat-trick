# Cat Trick

In my Seattle neighborhood of Ballard, sometimes cats will come up and greet me. Starting this summer, I began tracking that data on a Google Sheet. This website queries that Google Sheet and displays those cats. Meeting 3 cats in a single day is very rare. A Cat Trick. Sort of like how scoring 3 times in a hockey match is a Hat Trick. ðŸ˜€

This project uses Astro as the framework.
